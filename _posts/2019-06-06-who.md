Ruffin White is a Ph.D. student in the Contextual Robotics Institute at University of California San Diego, under the direction of Dr. Henrik Christensen. Having earned his Masters of Computer Science at the Institute for Robotics \& Intelligent Machines, Georgia Institute of Technology, he remains an active contributor to ROS and a collaborator with the Open Source Robotics Foundation.  His research interests include mobile robotics, with an focus on secure sub-systems design, as well as advancing repeatable and reproducible research in the field of robotics by improving development tools and standards for robotic software.

## Mikael Arguedas | Unaffiliated<img style="float: right;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}{{ post.url }}/img/bio/mikael.jpg" width="200px">
Mikael received his joint MSc from GeorgiaTech and ENSEA (France) in 2015 with a major in Electronics and Computer Engineering and a minor in Computer Science. He worked as a research assistant at GTRI and developed Computer Vision algorithms for detection of rigid and deformable objects. Before that, Mikael received a BS in Embedded Systems, Robotics and RTOS from IUT Cachan in 2011. He has been working on various ROS projects during the last few years. He worked at Open Robotics from 2015 to 2018 where he worked on ROS2 and more relevantly authored the SROS2 tools.

## Henrik Christensen | UCSD<img style="float: right;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}{{ post.url }}/img/bio/henrik.jpg" width="200px">
Dr. Henrik I. Christensen is a Professor of Computer Science at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering University of California San Diego. He is also Director of the Institute for Contextual Robotics. Prior to his coming to the University of California San Diego he was the founding director of the Institute for Robotics and Intelligent machines (IRIM) at Georgia Institute of Technology (2006-2016). Dr. Christensen does research on systems integration, human-robot interaction, mapping and robot vision. He has published more than 300 contributions across AI, robotics and vision. His research has a strong emphasis on "real problems with real solutions." A problem needs a theoretical model, implementation, evaluation, and translation to the real world.
