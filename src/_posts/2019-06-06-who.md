## Mikael Arguedas | Unaffiliated<img style="float: right;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}{{ post.url }}/img/bio/mikael.jpg" width="200px">
Mikael received his joint MSc from GeorgiaTech and ENSEA (France) in 2015 with a major in Electronics and Computer Engineering and a minor in Computer Science. He worked as a research assistant at GTRI and developed Computer Vision algorithms for detection of rigid and deformable objects. Before that, Mikael received a BS in Embedded Systems, Robotics and RTOS from IUT Cachan in 2011. He has been working on various ROS projects during the last few years. He worked at Open Robotics from 2015 to 2018 where he worked on ROS2 and more relevantly authored the SROS2 tools.

## Thomas Moulard | AWS Robotics <img style="float: right;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}{{ post.url }}/img/bio/tmoulard.jpg" width="200px">
Dr. Thomas Moulard is a Sr. Software Engineer at AWS Robotics, Amazon Web Services. Dr. Moulard received a Ph.D. from LAAS-CNRS in Toulouse, France in 2012 and was a Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the AIST from 2012 to 2014.
From 2016 to 2018, Dr. Moulard worked for Alphabet/Google first as a software engineer on an undisclosed robotics project and then, as the Technical Lead of the Daydream Data Infrastructure team, designing cloud services to evaluate computer vision algorithms performance.
In 2018, Dr. Moulard joined the AWS RoboMaker team. AWS RoboMaker is a service that makes it easy to develop, test, and deploy intelligent robotics applications at scale.

## Víctor Mayoral Vilches | Alias Robotics<img style="float: right;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}{{ post.url }}/img/bio/victor.jpg" width="200px">
Víctor is a Robotics Engineer at Alias Robotics. He obtained two BS degrees, one in Telecommunications Engineering and another in Computer Science at Universidad Rey Juan Carlos I in Madrid, Spain. After that he received an MSc in Telecommunications Engineering with periods of stay at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) in Trondheim, Norway and at the Hanyang University in Seoul, South Korea. Later, he dropped out his PhD and co-founded Erle Robotics in 2015 which was acquired in 2016. Víctor has experience building different robots (from drones to industrial robotic arms) and has contributed to ROS 2 actively since 2014. Currently, he works a robotics engineer and studies the security of a variety of robot technologies.

## Henrik Christensen | UCSD<img style="float: right;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}{{ post.url }}/img/bio/henrik.jpg" width="200px">
Dr. Henrik I. Christensen is a Professor of Computer Science at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering University of California San Diego. He is also Director of the Institute for Contextual Robotics. Prior to his coming to the University of California San Diego he was the founding director of the Institute for Robotics and Intelligent machines (IRIM) at Georgia Institute of Technology (2006-2016). Dr. Christensen does research on systems integration, human-robot interaction, mapping and robot vision. He has published more than 300 contributions across AI, robotics and vision. His research has a strong emphasis on "real problems with real solutions." A problem needs a theoretical model, implementation, evaluation, and translation to the real world.
