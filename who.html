<h2>Henrik Christensen | UCSD<img style="float: right;" src="/ROSCon19_Security_Workshop/img/bio/henrik.jpg" width="200px" /></h2>
<p>Dr. Henrik I. Christensen is a Professor of Computer Science at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering University of California San Diego. He is also Director of the Institute for Contextual Robotics. Prior to his coming to the University of California San Diego he was the founding director of the Institute for Robotics and Intelligent machines (IRIM) at Georgia Institute of Technology (2006-2016). Dr. Christensen does research on systems integration, human-robot interaction, mapping and robot vision. He has published more than 300 contributions across AI, robotics and vision. His research has a strong emphasis on “real problems with real solutions.” A problem needs a theoretical model, implementation, evaluation, and translation to the real world.</p>
