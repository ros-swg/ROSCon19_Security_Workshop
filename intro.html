<h2>Security workshop - Demonstrating vulnerabilities and ways to protect your robots</h2>

<p>This workshop will demonstrate different real-world attacks performed on robots while
teaching techniques on how to secure them against those attacks. This will include
teaching on how to design threat models for robotics, hardening the ROS ecosystem
through SROS2 as well as using several penetration testing tools to verify that the
robot is no longer vulnerable to those attacks.</p>
